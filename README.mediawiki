== Introduction ==

UMBEL is the Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer, designed to help content interoperate on the Web. UMBEL provides two valuable functions:

First, it is a broad, general reference structure of 34,000 concepts, which provides a scaffolding to link and interoperate other datasets and domain vocabularies. Second, it is a base vocabulary for the construction of other concept-based domain ontologies, also designed for interoperation.

== Documentation ==

General documentation and search and display functions related to UMBEL are available on [http://umbel.org UMBEL's main website]. From that website, you can easily search and browse the ontology. The UMBEL portal is supported by a rich set of APIs and functionality written in Clojure.
